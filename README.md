Understanding spread patterns of COVID 19 in the USA

This is the Advanced Data Science Capstone coursera online course offered by IBM. 

In this project, I decided to study the patterns in which COVID 19 spread in the USA. Having a rigid process model is important because there are many components here. There many data sources about COVID 19, some of which are not reliable and contain missing/null data. So there are trusted cloud-based services that offered open access to up-to-date data such as AWS. Also, in this particular problem, there are many factors that can play an important role in studying those patterns such as population, hospital capacity, etc.. More importantly, the data is dynamic and changes every day, so streaming analytics could be important.
